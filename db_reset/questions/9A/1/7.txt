instructions=You collect data every minute for an entire 24-hour day starting at midnight and store it in M. Every row is a different hour and every column is a different minute. Your first piece of data is therefore at the top left at M(1,1). You collected your data in military time mh:mm (where mh= [0,11], mm=[0, 59]), but the people who are going to be reading your matrix think in &ldquo;regular&rdquo; time (where rh= [1,12], rm=[1, 60]) and want the data for time rh:rm to be at location M(rh,rm) (right now aside from the last hour and minute it is at M(rh+1,rm+1)).
question=Create an array R so that the data is at regular time and can be accessed with R(rh,rm). Said another way, define R to be a copy of M &ldquo;shifted up&rdquo; (with the top row wrapping to the bottom) and &ldquo;shifted left&rdquo; (with the left column wrapping to the end). E.g.,
